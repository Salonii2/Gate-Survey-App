# Gate-Survey-App
The Gate Survey App is a mobile application designed to streamline the process of site surveys for gates, specifically sliding and swing gates. The app allows field engineers or technicians to efficiently capture real-time data and photos from site locations, with features aimed at simplifying gate installation and recommendation processes.
Key Features:
a) Photo Capture with Location:The app allows users to take high-resolution photos of the site, capturing key elements of the gate's surrounding area.
It automatically records the GPS location of the site, ensuring accurate record-keeping.

b) Gate Dimension Input:
Users can input gate dimensions (height, width, etc.) directly into the app. This helps in documenting the required size for gate installations.

c) Superimpose Gate Drawings:
Users can upload or select pre-designed gate models (both sliding and swing gates) and superimpose them onto the site photos. This helps visualize how the gate will look on-site before installation.

d) Real-time Sync:
All collected data is stored in the cloud, allowing users to access and share information with team members in real-time.

Benefits:
Efficiency: Reduces time spent on manual data collection and entry.
Accuracy: Ensures that all survey data is documented with precise measurements and GPS tagging.
Visualization: Allows clients and contractors to better visualize the gate options before installation, improving decision-making.
Recommendation Engine: Suggests the best gate options based on specific site conditions, reducing guesswork.
This app is ideal for companies that install gates or manage property development projects, as it improves communication, accuracy, and overall productivity.
